 👋 Hi.I’m @asvalverde01, a passionate about technology since i was young. 
I've learnt how to run multiple projects, be creative, make good decisions on what the best idea looks like, and work closely with others. I'm a fast learner and open to learning new skills.
Currently i am a software engineering student looking forward to be part of exiting projects.
